# 8086-RC4-Encryption
Developed an implementation of the RC4 algorithm in assembly language, the project involves reading a secret key from the user, processing it through the Key Scheduling Algorithm (KSA), and generating a pseudo-random sequence using the Pseudo-Random Generation Algorithm (PRGA).

Technologies Used: <br>
  - Assembly Language (8086) <br>
  - Emu8086 Emulator <br>
